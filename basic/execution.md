### stack for execution  
```  
stack is for each function, push variable, and modify any value by ebp pointer +- offset(e.g:-0x18(%rbp);  
and finally pop them after exiting the function.  
What is the stack? It's a special region of your computer's memory that stores temporary variables created by each function  
(including the main() function).   
The stack is a "LIFO" (last in, first out) data structure, that is managed and optimized by the CPU quite closely.
